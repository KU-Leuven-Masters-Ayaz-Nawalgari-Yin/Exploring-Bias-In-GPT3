Universally, there are clear patterns of women’s inferior access to resources and opportunities. Moreover, women are systematically under-represented in decision-making processes that shape their societies and their own lives. This pattern of inequality is a constraint to the progress of any society because it limits the opportunities of one-half of its population."

This requires addressing both the condition, as well as the position, of women and men in society. Gender mainstreaming therefore aims to strengthen the legitimacy of gender equality values by addressing known gender disparities and gaps in such areas as the division of labour between men and women; access to and control over resources; access to services, information and opportunities; and distribution of power and decision-making.||"
Q: Why is gender equality important?,"A: Gender equality is intrinsically linked to sustainable development and is vital to the realization of human rights for all.

Q: Is gender equality a concern for men?,"A: The achievement of gender equality implies changes for both men and women. More equitable relationships will need to be based on a redefinition of the rights and responsibilities of women and men in all spheres of life, including the workplace and the society at large. It is therefore crucial not to overlook gender as an aspect of men’s social identity. The lives of men are just as strongly influenced by gender as those of women. Societal norms and conceptions of masculinity and expectations of men as leaders, husbands or sons create demands on men and shape their behaviour. Men also have the right to assume a more nurturing role, and opportunities for them to do so should be promoted.||"

We must bear in mind that the principles of ""parity"" and pluralist democracy should be respected as the basis of individual identity and integrity and human rights and that human resources will be the most important factor in future structural change and development||"
